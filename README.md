# libssh scanner

## Introduction

* * *

This is a python based script to identify hosts vulnerable to CVE-2018-10933. Libssh scanner has two modes: passive (banner grabbing) and aggressive (bypass auth) to validate vulnerability's existence. By default, libssh scanner uses passive mode but supply the -a argument and aggressive mode will be used which provides more accurate results.

The vulnerability is present on versions of libssh 0.6+ and was remediated by a patch present in libssh 0.7.6 and 0.8.4. For more details: <https://www.libssh.org/2018/10/16/libssh-0-8-4-and-0-7-6-security-and-bugfix-release/>
